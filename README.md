# DoodleBug
This program simulates an ecological environment in which there is a 20x20 grid for Organisms to live in.
There are only two types of Organisms, doodlebugs and ants. Ants move randomly one space per turn and breed once every three turns.
Doodlebugs move into the space of an adjacent ant and eat it, if there are no adjacent ants they move randomly like the ants.
Doodlebugs breed every 8 turns and die of starvation if they havent eaten in 3 days.
Ants do not starve in this simulation.
